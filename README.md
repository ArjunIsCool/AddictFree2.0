AddictFree 2.0

Track usage of applications and set time limits to block them

NOTE:
Make sure you run as administrator, so that all features work as expected.
The block user input option should be used cautiously, it will actually block your keyboard and mouse input,
technically locking you from the system for the specified mins.

As simple as that, have fun :)

Made this for my school project
